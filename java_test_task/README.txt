I begin learn programming languages with serious intentions from this task. 
I knew nothing, when I start. But each day I read a lot, try, think, and at last fit all the requirements. 
Requirements were large as for test task. And then employer gave more and more (you can see them in doc files) but I handled everything and was very glad for this :)
Also there is necessary sql dumps. Test data is about my favourite characters from Big Bang Theory :)
First run the smallest one.
